# PEAKing Over It

Ever thought to yourself "these maps aren't heard enough!"? No? Well too bad! This mod utilizes Snosz's TerrainCustomizer mod to give each Ascent level its own unique terrain and obstacles, with the upper Ascent levels aiming to have a bennet foddy "getting over it" feel of impossibility.

This mod requires **all players to have it installed** in order to function properly.

## Installation: 
1) Click "Download" in Thunderstore

# Usage:
  Maps are automatically tied to the Ascent levels. Launching the Ascent in the terminal will take you straight to the corresponding map. 
  Until further testing, assume only the host can start the game, and that clients starting will cause problems.

  If you want to modify the maps:
    1) go into offline mode
    2) Click f1
    3) Make whatever map you want, name it "Ascentx" (x being the difficulty level you want)
    4) Open your Thunderstore mod profile storage location, copy BepInEx/plugins/Snosz-TerrainCustomiser/Map Save/Ascentx.json to BepInEx/plugins/Zobiah-AscentMapPairer/Map Saves/Ascentx.json.
       This will override the pre-installed terrain customizations, reverting will require either re-installing the mod, or reinstating a backup you made.
