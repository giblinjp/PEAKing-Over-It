SHORE
   - mess around with editor, figure out what sorts of hard terrain are viable
   - Urchin Hell (Ascent 7)
   - Maybe try something with removing 90% of terrain and adding big trees?
TROPICS
   - Tenderfoot rn is like just weird waterfall stuffs
   - poison hell
   - vine hell
   - can i get the floating island stuff working?
   - always raining

MESA
   - Dynamite Hell
   - Cactus Hell (specifically ascent part)
   - Remove the Interior? (I think that's actually doable)
   - Increase tornado count a LOT
   - Always Day? probably has to be pre ascent-4

ALPINE
   - Idk i need to see its editor to know more
   - Geyser hell (Ascent 6)
   - always snowing (Ascent 7)

CALDERA
   - super super tall stuff (done, current version tenderfoot)
   - super super tall, but spread out, with changes (sounds good for ascent 1?)
   - super fast lava, normal terrain (need to figure out which ascent(s) to associate with)
   - super sparse terrain 

KILN
   - lava rises 2x as fast or sooner?
   - sparse terrain?
